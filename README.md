ToDo Web App (Week 2)

It's a program from the design I made in the previous week. The program is a simple todo app using HTML, CSS and JS(All vanilla). 
I used local storage to store the task names and task status. 
I did cut some details that were going to take a lot of time(category, add category,...).

Here are what the app can do:
- List the tasks
- Create new tasks
- Change task status
- Search for task
- Delete tasks
- Edit tasks
