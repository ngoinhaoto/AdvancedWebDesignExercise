Why we need interact with Web API instead of handling everything on the Browser side?

I think its because

1. Web API allows you to store data on the server, which means you can have access to that data whether
   you're on your phone or laptop, for the sake of syncing
2. Web API can handle bigger amount of data and higher traffic load
   since localStorage only has 5MB per domain
3. Web API can allow users to share their tasks, and data, just like the reason 1 above
4. Better backup because users can erase their browser cache and lose all their
   local storage data
5. Better security, storing data on a server will always be better for users than on their
   own devices.
